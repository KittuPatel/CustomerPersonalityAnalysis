Project Idea: <br />
Analyzing the personality of customers helps in knowing the interests which further helps the
business in improving their products and understanding the trends in customer preferences.
For Example, If a particular product has great sales among a segment of customers, Businesses
can use this insight to extensively market the product to the target group and less to the other
customer segments. This approach enhances the probability of buying the product by the
customer. The analysis also supports product improvisation and knowing the latest trends. <br />

Steps: <br />
• Analyzing the domain of sales and understanding customer behavior. <br />
• Performing the Exploratory Data Analysis based on the insights gained from domain knowledge. <br />
• Pre-Processing of the data to remove the outliers, imputing the data for missing values. <br />
• Scaling the data to normalize the values. <br />
• Considering the important features by reducing the dimensionality using PCA. <br />
• Using the Clustering technique to identify the segments of customers. <br />
• Quantum Enhancements (Comparing Algorithm on Classical vs Quantum) <br />
